Learning some basic server administration. It has 9 main modules:
	Installing and Configuring Windows Server
	Active Directory & Identity with Windows Server
	Group Policy & Security with Windows Server
	Installing and Configuring Domain Name System (DNS))
	Installing and Configuring Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP))
	Installing and Configuring Windows Server Update Services (WSUS))
	Administration and Automation with Windows PowerShell
	Installing and Configuring System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM)
	Introduction to On-premises and Cloud Virtualization

Each module has some hands on practise and not only theory. My plan is to do one module a week from week 50 and the modules will be done in the oder listed above.
